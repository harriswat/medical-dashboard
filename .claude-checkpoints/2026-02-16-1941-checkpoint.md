# Checkpoint: Medical Dashboard - GSD Research Complete - 2026-02-16 19:41

## Session Summary
Started fresh medical dashboard project using GSD mode. Deleted both old projects (loan officer dashboard and previous medical dashboard attempt). Completed full GSD initialization with PROJECT.md, config, and comprehensive research phase (Stack, Features, Architecture, Pitfalls). Ready to define requirements and create roadmap.

## What Was Done
- ✅ **Project Cleanup**: Deleted `/Users/harrismacmini/Downloads/web-testing/surgery-command-center/` (loan officer dashboard - wrong project)
- ✅ **Project Cleanup**: Deleted `/Users/harrismacmini/Downloads/surgery-care-dashboard/` (40% complete medical dashboard - starting fresh)
- ✅ **GSD Initialization**: Created new project at `/Users/harrismacmini/Downloads/medical-dashboard/`
- ✅ **Git Setup**: Initialized repository with `.planning/` directory
- ✅ **PROJECT.md Created**: Comprehensive project context document with:
  - Core value: Patient/caregiver coordination for post-surgery care
  - Active requirements: Medication tracking, feeling check-ins, care activities, messaging, doctor info
  - Constraints: 2-3 day timeline (surgery is Wednesday), mobile-first, single-tenant
  - Context: Dad (patient) and Harris (caregiver), iPhone primary device
- ✅ **config.json Created**: YOLO mode, standard depth, parallel execution, balanced model profile
- ✅ **Research Phase Complete**: Spawned 4 parallel researchers:
  - **STACK.md**: Next.js 15 + Supabase + shadcn/ui + Zustand + Tailwind v4 (optimized for 48-72hr timeline)
  - **FEATURES.md**: Table stakes (medication tracking, symptom logging, care activities, messaging, doctor info) vs differentiators (calendar view, photo uploads) vs anti-features (EMR integration, HIPAA compliance, provider portals)
  - **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Real-time event-driven architecture with Supabase Realtime, offline-first strategy, role-based component composition, 5-phase build order
  - **PITFALLS.md**: Sync failures (68% of health apps), over-engineering (timeline killer), medication UX (30-50% adherence failure), alert fatigue, HIPAA compliance, mobile-first considerations
- ✅ **SUMMARY.md Created**: Research synthesis with 5 suggested phases, timeline confidence (HIGH), and roadmap implications
- ✅ **All Files Committed**: 4 git commits (PROJECT.md, config.json, research files, SUMMARY.md)

## Current State
- **Working**:
  - ✅ GSD project initialized at `/Users/harrismacmini/Downloads/medical-dashboard/`
  - ✅ Git repository with 4 commits
  - ✅ PROJECT.md with full context (core value, requirements, constraints)
  - ✅ Research phase 100% complete (Stack, Features, Architecture, Pitfalls, Summary)
  - ✅ Clear technology stack recommendation (Next.js 15 + Supabase)
  - ✅ 5-phase roadmap structure proposed by research

- **In Progress**:
  - ⚠️ Requirements definition (next step in GSD workflow)
  - ⚠️ Roadmap creation (after requirements)
  - ⚠️ Phase planning (after roadmap)

- **Blocked**:
  - None - workflow is proceeding smoothly

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 30 minutes)
1. **Define Requirements** (GSD Step 7):
   - Review research FEATURES.md and categorize features
   - Create `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` with:
     - v1 Requirements (medication tracking, feeling check-ins, care activities, messaging, doctor info)
     - v2 Requirements (calendar view, photo uploads, export features)
     - Out of Scope (EMR integration, multi-tenant, HIPAA compliance infrastructure)
   - Assign REQ-IDs to each requirement (MED-01, FEEL-01, CARE-01, etc.)
   - Commit REQUIREMENTS.md

2. **Create Roadmap** (GSD Step 8):
   - Spawn gsd-roadmapper agent with PROJECT.md + REQUIREMENTS.md + SUMMARY.md
   - Agent will create ROADMAP.md with 5 phases:
     - Phase 1: Foundation & Data Architecture
     - Phase 2: Medication Tracking
     - Phase 3: Care Activity Logging & Feeling Check-ins
     - Phase 4: Messaging & Notifications
     - Phase 5: PWA Configuration & Polish
   - Commit ROADMAP.md and STATE.md

3. **Start Phase Planning**:
   - Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to create detailed execution plan for Foundation phase
   - Or run `/gsd:discuss-phase 1` to gather context before planning

### Timeline
- **Tonight (Sunday)**: Complete requirements + roadmap (30-60 min)
- **Monday**: Plan and execute Phase 1 (Foundation) and Phase 2 (Medication Tracking)
- **Tuesday**: Execute Phase 3-4 (Activities, Messaging, Notifications)
- **Wednesday Morning**: Execute Phase 5 (PWA, Polish, Deploy) before surgery

## Important Context

**Environment:**
- **Project Directory**: `/Users/harrismacmini/Downloads/medical-dashboard/`
- **Git Status**: Clean working directory, 4 commits, on branch `main`
- **GSD Mode**: Active, YOLO mode (auto-approve), standard depth, parallel execution enabled
- **Model Profile**: Balanced (Sonnet for most agents)

**Key Context:**
- **Surgery Date**: Wednesday (this week) - HARD DEADLINE
- **Timeline**: 48-72 hours to ship (2-3 days)
- **Users**: Dad (patient, iPhone) and Harris (caregiver)
- **Primary Device**: iPhone (mobile-first design critical)
- **Backend**: Supabase project exists (ref: `ishhmpxejnzpoxuwaajn`) - can reuse or create new
- **Deployment**: Vercel or Digital Ocean (both CLIs available)

**Technology Decisions (from research):**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router) + React 19 + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Realtime + Auth + Storage)
- **UI**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS v4
- **State**: Zustand (lightweight, mobile-friendly)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod
- **Dates**: date-fns
- **Deployment**: Vercel (zero-config)

**Critical Success Factors (from Pitfalls research):**
1. Offline-first architecture from day one (cannot retrofit)
2. Ruthless scope management (review every 12 hours)
3. Test on real iPhone (not just browser DevTools)
4. Plain language everywhere (no medical jargon)
5. Large tap targets (44pt minimum)
6. Conflict UI designed upfront

**Out of Scope (Important!):**
- ❌ EMR/EHR integration
- ❌ Multi-tenant support
- ❌ HIPAA compliance infrastructure (personal use only)
- ❌ Provider portals
- ❌ Video calling
- ❌ Complex authentication (using localStorage profiles)

## Continue Prompt
